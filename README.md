# Optimal Path Finding using Ant Colony Optimization
This is the code repository for KF6003 Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Module.

The project exhibits the creation and optimization of paths through pheromone trails of multiple agents, also known as Ant Colony Optimization.

# Current Version

- Multiple Ants/Agents spawn and randomly wander.
- Border Collision
- Random Food Generation is implemented.
- Ant Pheromones change depending on the vicinity of food.'
- Pheromones disappear over time.

# To Do:

- Object Collision
- Food Tracking
- Pheromone Tracking
- Food Collection
- Danger Pheromone
- Empty Pheromone
- Procedural Ant Creation.
